# Meteor integration for Visual Studio Code

This extension brings support for Meteor to Visual Studio Code. The goal is to create an extension with complete support specific to Meteor.

> It's currently under development and the set of features is limited. See the list below for more details.

## Features

### Intellisense auto completion

For [Meteor's API](http://docs.meteor.com/api) the extension provides auto completion.

> Right now it supports all direct members of the API. Instance properties or methods are not covered yet. This is a bit more complex.
